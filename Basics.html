    <h1>Here are the basics of programming</h1>

    <h2>Variables</h2>

    <script>
        // This is a single line comment in JavaScript
        /* This is a mutiline comment in JavaScript */

        // Lets create our first variable
        var firstName = "Kaheel";
        console.log("the value of our first name variable is: " + firstName)
        // Create the varaiable, set it to an empty string;
        // we will give it value later
        var lastName = "Robinson";
        // The 3rd way to create a variable - this is a valid way of creating a variable in JavaScript
        // DO NOT USE THIS METHOD
        middleName = "M";
    </script>
    <h2>Functions</h2>
    <script>
       // This is a JavaScript function; we need to use the keyword function
       // Functions are awesome - you write code one time and can reuse it throughout your program
       // Functions help to organize the code
       // Function names should usually be some sort of actiopn
       // Always include the () - sometimes there will be variables(s) in between the () or they may be empty
       // Always make sure there are a matching set of curly braces
        function runCalc(){ // Do not mix ; and {}
            // Whatever code is in between the curly braces belongs to this function
            // We will create a variable called num1, and we will give it a default value of 0
            // JavaScript should assume that this is a numberic datatype
            var num1 = 0;
            var nub2 = 0;

            // We want to prompt the user for a number, using the built in JavaScript prompt function
            // The prompt function takes an argument (variable) - the text that will be shown to the user with the promt
            // The prompt function returns the value that the user entered in
            // Set the num1 variable equal to the other value the user entered in

            // Do while loop will run at least 1 time, and then can run as many times as needed
            do{
                // Make the user enter a number; this loop will run until a number is entered
                num1 = prompt("Please enter number 1; "); // Most line of JavaScript need a semi-colon (;) at the end
            // If is not a number is true (they entered text) or the user entered 0 the loop will keep running
            }while(isNaN(num1) || num1 == 0);

            // Get another number from the user and assign it to the num2 variable
            num2 = prompt("Please enter number 2; ");

            // Let's add num1 and num2 together and store that value in the variable
            // The built in JavaScript function parseInt make sure that JavaScript treats the num1 and num2 variable as integers (whole numbers)
            var total = parseInt(num1) + parseInt(num2);
            
            // Call the built in JavaScript function called alert - this will show a message to the user  
            // It should show our numbers and the total 
            // alert("The total of " + num1 + " plus  " + num2 + " is " + total)
        }
        // We have created the function, now we need to call it so that the function code will run 
        // The () are blank because we don't need to pass any information into this function
        // runCalc();

        // The code here does not belong to the function
    </script>
    <h2>Decision Logic (if/else)</h2>
    <script>
        // Creating a variable called aga with default value of 5
        // 1 equal sign is assignment, the variable on the left is assigned the value on the right
        var age = 5
        // 2 equal sign means check for equality, or does the value on the left side match the value on the right
        // If statement, test a value, if the value of the age variable true, run the if block code
        if(age == 5){
            // This code will run if the value of the age variable is 5
           // alert("age=" + age);
        }
        // Else if will be checked when the if statement does not evalute to true
        else if(age == 6){
            // This code will run if the value of the age variable is 6
           // alert("age=" + age);
        }
        // The else statement is a catch-all, it will run if none of the if/else statement are true
        else{
            // This code will run if he value of the age variable is anyting other than 5 or 6
           // alert("age was not 5 or 6");
        }
    </script>
    <h2>Loops</h2>
    <script>
        // Loops run code repeatedly
        // They are great for displaying data
        // There are 2 basic types of loops - for loop and while loop

        // For loops are generally used when you know how many times you want the code to run
        // 1st part of our for loop is a counter variable, and we are setting it to a default value of 0
        // 2nd part the condition that the for loop will test on each run
        // The loop will run as long as this condition is true
        // 3rd part is incrementing the counter variable each time the loop runs
        // i++ is the same as 1 = 1 + 1
        for(var i = 0; i < 5; i++){
           // alert("i=" + i);
        }
        // While loops are generally used when you do not know how many times you want the code to run
        // conter variable, set to default value of 0
        var counter = 0
        // While loot will run until counter is equal to 5
        while(counter < 5){
            // Display the value of counter in an alert
            //alert("counter=" + counter);
            // Increases the value of counter by 1 every time the while loop runs
            counter++;
        }
        // While loops are generally used when you do not know how many times you want the code to run
